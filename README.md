# Project Description  
In this project, we aim to simulate a 4G wireless network using the 3-ns simulation tool and analyze its various parameters. This network implements a simple encryption system.  

The network consists of 3 nodes:
- Client node
- Master node
- Mapper node  

client wants to send a message to the master node usign UDP protocol. The client node encrypts the message using a simple encryption algorithm and sends it to the master node. The master node gets the message and sends it to the mapper nodes using TCP protocol. The mapper nodes decrypt the message and send it to the client node using UDP protocol. At this program, we want to learn how to simulate a network with different encryption algorithms and analyze the network's performance.  

Here's the picture of the network we want to simulate and analyze:
